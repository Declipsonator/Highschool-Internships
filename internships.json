Polarimetry is a passive, remote-sensing technique that provides unparalleled capabilities for characterizing atmospheric aerosols. Aerosol particles in the atmosphere are highly variable and depend greatly upon their source (e.g., sea salt, yellow sand, Asian dust, and soot from power plants, diesel exhaust, fires, waste incineration, etc.). Knowledge of the fundamental properties of aerosols and their interactions with the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are relevant to NASA and other Agencies (e.g., Army operations, infrastructure, and stewardship).

Current startup companies in the United States are proposing:\r\n\r\n* passenger-carrying air vehicles that can move people between different urban areas 2-10 times faster than today\u2019s transportation, at lower environmental cost and with less noise \r\n\r\n* automated cargo vehicles that take advantage of today\u2019s underutilized small airports to ship goods regionally\r\n\r\n* emergency response operations that allow faster response times with less risk to emergency responders\r\n\r\nTraditionally, new modes of transportation in the United States have benefited upper social classes at the expense of underrepresented and lower socioeconomic classes. Several recent studies in transportation have explored this disparity, and research has highlighted factors that contribute to transportation equity. In this effort, we will examine this previous work as it applies to the broader, current transportation system. First, we will use our literature search to highlight and educate the current emerging aviation stakeholders on equity strategies that are directly applicable to these novel operations. Second, we will use our literature research to make informed recommendations for experiments and data collection that will increase our understanding about how these new aviation concepts can be encouraged to provide equity as an emergent property.",

While familiarity with Office 365 applications like Teams and OneDrive is beneficial, it is not required. Comprehensive training for all other activities will be provided by mentors. The role is primarily on-site, with telework options available as appropriate. If preferred, a full-time on-site office arrangement can also be accommodated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core responsibilities of metadata entry and NARA transfer preparation, the selected individual will gain valuable exposure to the digitization process and the technical administration of the systems and servers housing the digital archives.

        "description": "With the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a new era of astronomical discoveries was made possible. One bottleneck in the effective utilization of JWST and similar future telescopes, however, is the removal of data contaminated with cosmic rays that hit the detectors. Part of the data preprocessing and reduction involves dealing with noise generated by processes that include dark current, readout, and cosmic rays. During the readout process, successive frames are averaged and aggregated using an up-the-ramp readout scheme. For each pixel, the increase from one frame to the other follows a given rate, but cosmic ray hits lead to a sudden jump (see Figure 1 in [1] for a generic illustration of the up-the-ramp readout scheme). Current methods involve a manual examination of different rejection thresholds to find one that provides the best results for the intended observation (see [2] for a description of the current algorithm used in the JWST pipeline to detect these jumps). This time-consuming and inefficient process slows down the returned science.\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and apply a machine learning algorithm in an unsupervised setting that can learn from the data to detect these jumps between frames and thus identify pixels hit by cosmic ray jumps. The intern will work closely with the mentor and other collaborators, discussing/implementing possible techniques to solve this challenge. The candidate must be proficient in Python and have experience with libraries related to machine learning, deep learning, and data processing such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, SciPy. Experience dealing with astronomical data and high-performance computing are preferred.\r\n \r\nReferences\r\n \r\n[1] https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/understanding-exposure-times#UnderstandingExposureTimes-uptheramp, accessed 10/20/2022\r\n[2] https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/jump/description.html, accessed 10/20/2022\r\n\r\n*Make sure to apply only if you are fluent in Python coding and has experience in deep learning.

These telescopes work based on transit photometry and their pipelines return a list of threshold crossing events (TCEs) whose light signature resemble a planet.

We have been exploring deep learning technology for automatic classification of TCEs and finding planets from non-TCEs. Using our in-house tools, we have been able to identify new planets (subject to confirmation). We also have identified multiple ways to improve the existing classifiers and we are looking for interns who can explore these new ways.

In the last several years, simulations became an important part of hardware development in the field of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL). Modern RL methods show incredible results with virtual robot models learning to avoid obstacles while exploring unknown terrains. Many of these test cases describe theoretical fields of application and are not yet used in a real environment. RL can learn from experiences and apply the learned knowledge to real life problems.
