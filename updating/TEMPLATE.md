# High School Internships Directory

Welcome to the High School Internships Directory, a curated list of opportunities for high school students to gain valuable experience across various fields. The internships are organized by subject areas, making it easier for students to find opportunities that align with their interests and goals.

If you find that an internship needs to be updated or removed, please help us maintain the accuracy of this directory by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Declipsonator/Highschool-Internships/issues).
