        "description": "This part-time internship opportunity provides an advanced high school student with the opportunity to examine today\u2019s control systems and provide an independent analysis of their capabilities and features.  The project will focus on the different control systems NASA uses such as Allen Bradley, MatLab, Opto22, and LataPanda, but it is anticipated that all commercial control systems will be examined in this opportunity for PLC, PAC, PID, and APC systems. The objective is to create a list of advantages and disadvantages for the industry control system types to include metrics in cost, functionality, replaceability, modularity, and reliability.",
