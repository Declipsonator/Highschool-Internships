Knowledge of the fundamental properties of aerosols and their interactions with the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are relevant to NASA and other Agencies (e.g., Army operations, infrastructure, and stewardship).

The student will support development with a NASA engineer/scientist to utilize wind velocities, temperature, pressure, and humidity from a database to apply and test state-of-the-art AI/ML methods for wind predictions in urban environments. Desired intern skills and expertise include python, matrix operations, statistics, and experience with AI/ML algorithms such as NN, GAN, cGAN, etc. and familiar with Pytorch or TensorFlow. One of the AI/ML approaches being explored is the use of Generative AI, specifically Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN).  The student will develop testing, tuning and evaluation code for the cGAN method to support the production of accurate and insightful wind prediction results.  Where possible, this code will be generalized, such that, it can be reused with other AI/ML approaches for wind prediction. In addition, the student will conduct literature reviews to identify other candidate AI/ML algorithms for infusion into the aviation domain.

        "description": "Aerosols, such as particulate pollution, dust, smoke and sea salt, play important roles in Earth's radiative balance, cloud and precipitation formation, fertilization of ecosystems, air quality and human health. Retrieval of aerosol parameters from space-based spectral radiometric measurements has been based on physical understanding of radiative transfer, particles and the environment that these particles inhabit. For decades, physically-based methods have produced a suite of highly useful products. However, physically-based methods work best when their assumptions are accurate, and tend to fail in situations where the real world and retrieval assumptions do not match well. Especially difficult for aerosol retrieval algorithms is the separation of aerosol from clouds, identifying the type of aerosol from space and parameterizing the surface reflectance beneath the aerosol layers. In this project, a group with experience in physically-based aerosol remote sensing wants to explore Machine Learning (ML) techniques with a student experienced in Data Science and ML. Possible projects might involve applying ML to one component of the retrieval, such as separating aerosols from clouds, or detecting aerosol types from multispectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery.",

        "description": "With the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a new era of astronomical discoveries was made possible. One bottleneck in the effective utilization of JWST and similar future telescopes, however, is the removal of data contaminated with cosmic rays that hit the detectors. Part of the data preprocessing and reduction involves dealing with noise generated by processes that include dark current, readout, and cosmic rays. During the readout process, successive frames are averaged and aggregated using an up-the-ramp readout scheme. For each pixel, the increase from one frame to the other follows a given rate, but cosmic ray hits lead to a sudden jump (see Figure 1 in [1] for a generic illustration of the up-the-ramp readout scheme). Current methods involve a manual examination of different rejection thresholds to find one that provides the best results for the intended observation (see [2] for a description of the current algorithm used in the JWST pipeline to detect these jumps). This time-consuming and inefficient process slows down the returned science.\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and apply a machine learning algorithm in an unsupervised setting that can learn from the data to detect these jumps between frames and thus identify pixels hit by cosmic ray jumps. The intern will work closely with the mentor and other collaborators, discussing/implementing possible techniques to solve this challenge. The candidate must be proficient in Python and have experience with libraries related to machine learning, deep learning, and data processing such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, SciPy. Experience dealing with astronomical data and high-performance computing are preferred.\r\n \r\nReferences\r\n \r\n[1] https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/understanding-exposure-times#UnderstandingExposureTimes-uptheramp, accessed 10/20/2022\r\n[2] https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/jump/description.html, accessed 10/20/2022\r\n\r\n*Make sure to apply only if you are fluent in Python coding and has experience in deep learning.
