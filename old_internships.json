        "description": "Aerosols, such as particulate pollution, dust, smoke and sea salt, play important roles in Earth's radiative balance, cloud and precipitation formation, fertilization of ecosystems, air quality and human health. Retrieval of aerosol parameters from space-based spectral radiometric measurements has been based on physical understanding of radiative transfer, particles and the environment that these particles inhabit. For decades, physically-based methods have produced a suite of highly useful products. However, physically-based methods work best when their assumptions are accurate, and tend to fail in situations where the real world and retrieval assumptions do not match well. Especially difficult for aerosol retrieval algorithms is the separation of aerosol from clouds, identifying the type of aerosol from space and parameterizing the surface reflectance beneath the aerosol layers. In this project, a group with experience in physically-based aerosol remote sensing wants to explore Machine Learning (ML) or other advanced computation techniques with a student experienced in Data Science and/or ML. Possible projects might involve applying ML to one component of the retrieval, such as separating aerosols from clouds, or detecting aerosol types from multispectral and/or multi-temporal satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nEligible applicants for this project must reside within 50 miles of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has partnered with the National Space Club & Foundation to offer a six-week program for High School students within a 50 mile radius of GSFC Greenbelt or Wallops Flight Facility (WFF).

The areas of focus include:\r\n\r\nQuantifying Data Uncertainty:\r\nEnhancing uncertainty characterization by integrating ML models with traditional uncertainty estimation frameworks, providing robust error metrics for pixel level satellite-derived aerosol data.\r\n\r\nRefining Aerosol Model Assumptions:\r\nCombining ML-driven insights with traditional categorizing techniques to refine assumptions about aerosol properties such as size distribution, refractive index, and vertical profiles, resulting in more accurate retrievals.\r\n\r\nImproving Aerosol Subtype Detection:\r\nUtilizing ML classification techniques alongside traditional optical property analysis to enhance the detection and differentiation of aerosol subtypes (e.g., dust and smoke) using combined passive and active satellite observations.\r\n\r\nEligible applicants for this project must reside within 50 miles of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has partnered with the National Space Club & Foundation to offer a six-week program for High School students within a 50 mile radius of GSFC Greenbelt or Wallops Flight Facility (WFF).

These BSDF data products must be converted to a format that can be input into FRED Optical Analysis Software or Zemax Optics Studio (ZOS) and then verified by simulating an ideal computer-based scatterometer making measurements from a representative sample coupon. Archiving data in this usable form will save a good deal of time and money on future programs requiring stray light, illumination, imaging and radiometric analyses.\r\n\r\nThis effort already has a good deal of available data which a student with Python/Matlab skills could process to render the data in a useable format for FRED/ZOS. I've already constructed a simulation of a scatterometer (e.g. such as one built by The Scatter Works (Bozeman, MT) or CASI (Tuscon, AZ)) which the student may use to verify the conversion and compare with original measurement(s).

Autonomous mobile robots are being introduced in many space applications, including planetary sample collection and surface exploration. In the last several years, simulations became an important part of hardware development in the field of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL). Modern RL methods show incredible results with virtual robot models learning to avoid obstacles while exploring unknown terrains. Many of these test cases describe theoretical fields of application and are not yet used in a real environment. RL can learn from experiences and apply the learned knowledge to real life problems.

        "description": "The proposed project aims to investigate the properties and spatial distribution of plasma waves observed simultaneously at different magnetic local times (MLT) using data from the Van Allen Probes mission. This twin-spacecraft mission provided unprecedented in situ observations of the Earth's radiation belts, enabling a comprehensive study of wave-particle interactions. Waves such as electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, whistler-mode chorus, and ultra-low-frequency(ULF) waves play crucial roles in the dynamics of energetic particles, including their acceleration, transport, and precipitation. However, the generation, propagation, and effects of these waves often exhibit significant local time asymmetries due to variations in magnetospheric conditions, such as plasma density, geomagnetic field strength, and solar wind driving.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the Van Allen Probes' spatially separated orbits, this project will analyze wave activity simultaneously across two different local time sectors. Key objectives include characterizing the frequency, amplitude, and polarization of the observed waves and identifying the conditions under which specific wave types dominate in different MLT regions. For example, EMIC waves are often stronger in the dusk-to-midnight sector, while whistler-mode chorus waves are prevalent in the dawn region. The project will explore how these waves evolve during quiet and geomagnetically disturbed intervals and their coupling with particle populations. The outcomes will enhance our understanding of radiation belt dynamics, wave-particle interactions, and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, providing critical insights for space weather prediction and mitigation strategies. This project aligns with advancing our knowledge of fundamental plasma processes in the near-Earth space environment.\r\n\r\nEligible applicants for this project must reside within 50 miles of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has partnered with the National Space Club & Foundation to offer a six-week program for High School students within a 50 mile radius of GSFC Greenbelt or Wallops Flight Facility (WFF).

        "description": "Air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) adversely affect air quality, public health, and the ecosystems. They are largely emitted from human activities such as power generation and transportation (and from volcanoes, in the case of SO2). While these air pollutants are typically short-lived, with a lifetime of just hours to days in the atmosphere, they can travel over thousands of kilometers under favorable meteorological conditions. This process, referred to as long-range transport, can turn air pollution from a local phenomenon into a global environmental issue. NASA\u2019s earth observing satellites provide global observations of several air pollutants including NO2 and SO2, thus offering opportunities to monitor, track, and assess the impact of long-range transport.\r\n\r\nThe student in this project will use NASA satellite data to study long-range transport of air pollution. The focus will be on a cluster of large power plants in South Africa that is a known major source of NO2 and SO2. The intern will use and develop computer software to visualize NO2 and SO2 data from satellites and other relevant datasets, identify and track long-range transport events, and conduct statistical analysis on the identified events. The student will also explore machine learning based techniques to automate the detection and tracking of such events. During the project, the student can expect to work with and receive guidance from scientists who are experienced in satellite remote sensing, data analysis, and machine learning.\r\n\r\nEligible applicants for this project must reside within 50 miles of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has partnered with the National Space Club & Foundation to offer a six-week program for High School students within a 50 mile radius of GSFC Greenbelt or Wallops Flight Facility (WFF).
